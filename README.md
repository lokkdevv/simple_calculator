# Simple Calculator
A simple calculator written in C++ built for the terminal. It supports the basic arithmetic operations.

This is my first C++ project. The calculator currently runs in the terminal and supports basic arithmetic operations.

I plan to add a graphical interface using **Raylib** in the future.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Built with future GUI support in mind

## Build & Run
Compile with a standard C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
